    <B>OTP Bypass:</B>
    This refers to the act of circumventing or bypassing the security mechanism of a one-time-passwords(OTP) system.
    it is a commonly used as second factor authentication method to enhance the security of online accounts and transcations.<br>
    it can occur through various mechanisms that are listed below: 
      i) phishing: attackers trick users into providing their OTP's through phishing emails, SMS, fake websites that are usually by impersonating legitimate entities 
      <br>ii) vulnerabilities in OTP generation: weaknesses or vulnerabilities in OTP generation process can be exploited to predict the valid OTP's without proper authorization
      <br>iii) SIM swap attacks: attackers gain controllers of victims phone no by convincing the mobile carrier to transfer it to new SIM card under their control, allowing them to recieve OTP's intended for the victim.<br>

  <p style="color: white;"> <b>Causes</b><br>

    <b>Lack of Proper Authorization Checks:</b> The primary cause of IDOR vulnerabilities is the absence of proper authorization checks on user requests. If the application doesn't verify whether the user is authorized to access a particular object or resource, it becomes vulnerable to IDOR attacks.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Predictable Object References:</b> If an application uses predictable or sequential identifiers for its internal objects, such as numeric IDs or incrementing values, attackers can easily guess or manipulate these identifiers to access unauthorized resources.<br><br>
    <b>Insecure Direct Object References in URLs:</b> Exposing internal object references directly in URLs or other client-side parameters can lead to IDOR vulnerabilities. Attackers can modify these parameters to access resources they're not supposed to access.
  </p>
  <p style="color: white;"><b>Recommendations</b><br>
    <b>Implement Strong Authentication Mechanisms: </b>Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods, including OTP, alongside other factors such as passwords, biometrics, or hardware tokens. This adds an extra layer of security and makes it more difficult for attackers to bypass authentication.
    <br>
    <br>
      <b>Protect OTP Generation and Verification Processes: </b>Secure the processes involved in generating and verifying OTPs. Use secure algorithms and cryptographic techniques to prevent tampering or manipulation of OTPs.
<br><br>
      <b>Rate Limiting and Account Lockout:</b> Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks and unauthorized attempts to guess OTPs.<br>
